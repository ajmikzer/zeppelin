We're very excited - not just because of the inordinate amount of caffeine based products consumed - 
but also because our team are putting together 
the final missing parts to the biggest Google related event in Armenia - [GDG DevFest Armenia 2014](http://devfest.gdg.am/). 

So should you also be excited? Well yes... and here's why!

* **Attendance**: we're expecting over 250 attendees
* **Topic**: 2 days of open source technologies 
* **Date**: 22-23 of November, expect hackathon, workshops and conference
* **Venue**: TUMO Center for Creative Technologies - as usual we'll make technical event in this awesome place.
* **Speakers**: we're in the process of finalising the list of speakers

More details about speakers, DevFest Hackathon, Conference Agenda and Speakers will appear in subsequent posts, meantime like us on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/gdgarmenia) and add to circles in [Google+](http://gdg.am/+) in order not to miss any cool stuff about festival.
